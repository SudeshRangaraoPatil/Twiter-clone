Developed an Instagram clone using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The app allows users to create accounts, post photos, follow other users, like and comment on posts, and view a feed of content from followed users. Implemented real-time notifications, secure authentication, and a scalable backend. Features include profile pages, direct messaging, and image uploading.
